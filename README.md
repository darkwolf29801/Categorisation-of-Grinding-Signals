## Abstract

The project was done as a part of AI-ML hackathon conducted by PALS IIT Madras. Our solution focuses on determining the type of grinding process- Single plunge, Face - Single plunge or Face – Multi plunge grinding. The ML model we developed is capable of predicting the type of process with 99% accuracy
